# Social Learning WTF (aka Wikipedia Task Force)

## The layman Social Learning community needs you!
Ever wondered what information students who are newly approaching Social Learning will find? How Social Learning research is portrayed to the public? How precise information sources that are most easily accessible to the average web user are?

At our recent workshop, we found many Wikipedia entries to be insufficient or misleading. And so we decided to get involved in public outreach. And this is our first project: **we are improving social learning-related webpages on Wikipedia!** We call it Social Learning Wikipedia Task Force, a group of researchers and affiliates who are ‘cleaning up’, improving the quality of information available and expanding the number of Wikipedia pages dedicated to Social Learning and related topics. 

We will start with coordinated group activities. In the future, we will (hopefully) reach a point with individual contributions.
